# Searchable-Image-PDF-Creat-O-mat
This script creates a searchable PDF out of a PDF with one or more scanned pages. It is possible to drag and drop one or multiple PDF files onto this batch file to start the process. But it is also possible to use the command line (&lt;script filename> [pdf filename #1] [pdf filename #2] ... [pdf filename #n]) too.
